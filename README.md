# Image_Repo
Repository for all snapshots/ images for projects I've shared. 

### Structure
Directories on the Main Branch base contain the images for that associated repository commit. Likewise, the folder structure follows the structure of those repositories to keep things nicely categorized.

##### Special Notes
If you are interested in what have done, am doing, and will do, this would be the repository to watch.
This is barring the initial commits to document the projects I've been involved with and am allowed to share, since I am very much behind on documentation. I apologize if there are a flurry of seemingly unrelated commits at a time. This sort of activity will continue until I am caught up.
